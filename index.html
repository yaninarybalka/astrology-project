              In astrology, the signs of the zodiac are the 12 constellations
              (called zodiacal constellations) that appear in a particular
              portion of the sky called <em>the zodiac</em>. <br />
              Despite its basis in astronomy, the word zodiac is mainly
              associated with and most often used in the context of astrology,
              in which it refers to a diagram (often a circular one)
              representing this belt and showing the symbols associated with
              each of the 12 constellationsâ€”these are the signs of the zodiac or
              zodiac signs. (The term sign of the zodiac can also refer to one
              of the 12 sections into which the zodiac is divided.) <br />
