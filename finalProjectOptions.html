            In astrology, the signs of the zodiac are the 12 constellations
            (called zodiacal constellations) that appear in a particular portion
            of the sky called <em>the zodiac</em>. <br />
            Despite its basis in astronomy, the word zodiac is mainly associated
            with and most often used in the context of astrology, in which it
            refers to a diagram (often a circular one) representing this belt
            and showing the symbols associated with each of the 12
            constellations‚Äîthese are the signs of the zodiac or zodiac signs.
            (The term sign of the zodiac can also refer to one of the 12
            sections into which the zodiac is divided.) <br />
